Lastpass created encryption algorithms so we can create a variety of passwords for all of our accounts and store them securely.
Hopper created an algorithm to predict flight prices, which lets users know when to buy tickets at the flight's cheapest price/time.
Digit created an automatic saving algorithm, which tracks your daily checking account balance, income, and spending and saves enough every day so you keep a manageable amount in your checking account and don't overdraw.

3. I think speed constitutes an efficient algorithm. I think what contributes to the speed of the algorithm is the size of the data set it is working with, along with the number of steps needed to take to go through each element and the memory required along the way.
