1. A real-life scenario that uses linear search could be finding a word in a dictionary by scanning each word in alphabetical order until the target word is found.

2. A real-life scenario that uses binary search could be finding a specific artist in a massive music library. Instead of using linear search and scrolling through starting at A to find the artist, you go to the middle and compare from there until you find the artist.

3. 7 iterations

4. 3 iterations

5. In this case you'd have to use linear search since it's unsorted, and binary search only works with sorted lists.

6. Here it would be easier to use binary search since it's much more likely there would be less iterations.

1.

function dictionarySearch(data, searchQuery) {
  var answer = 'not found';
  for (var i = 0, len = data.length; i < len; i++) {
    if (data[i] === searchQuery) {
      answer = i;
    }
  }
  return answer;
}

var words = []
var result = dictorarySearch(words, "Albatross");
console.log(result);

2.

function findFish(collection, targetFish){
  for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++){
    if (collection[i] === targetFish){
      return "You've found the fish!";
    }
  }
  return "That fish isn't in this tank.";
}
