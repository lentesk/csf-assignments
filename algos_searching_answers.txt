1. A real-life scenario that uses linear search could be finding a specific book in an unorganized bookshelf. You'd look through each book starting from the left u

2. A real-life scenario that uses binary search could be finding a specific artist in a massive music library. Instead of using linear search and scrolling through starting at A to find the artist, you go to the middle and compare from there until you find the artist.

3. 7 iterations

4. 3 iterations

5. In this case you'd have to use linear search since it's unsorted, and binary search only works with sorted lists.

6. Here it would be easier to use binary search since it's much more likely there would be less iterations.

1.

while (first <= last) {
  var mid = (first + last) / 2;
  if(collection[mid] > word) { first = mid -1;
}
else if (collection[mid] < word){
  first = mid + 1;
}
else {
  return mid;
}
}
return "Sorry, that word was not found.";
}

2.

function findFish(collection, targetFish){
  for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++){
    if (collection[i] === targetFish){
      return "You've found the fish!";
    }
  }
  return "That fish isn't in this tank.";
}
